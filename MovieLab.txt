To begin, I constructed the make file.
Before getting too far into coding functions, my objective was to get the movie playing as quickly as possible so that I could verify that the functions were delivering the expected results.
As a result, I had to complete the fundamentals, such as CreateImageList, DeleteImageList, AppendRGBImage, AppendYUVImage, CreateImageEntry, RGB2YUVMovie, YUV2RGBMovie, and so on. After that, I worked on receiving commands.
I assisted with this by utilizing the lecture slides, the pdf, and the code that was provided.
I was able to get the movie to play after finishing the fundamentals.
I then began working on the fundamental DIPs functions.

Fast Forward and crop both revolved around deleting image entries.
	I made a new function DeleteImageEntry which I also utilized in the DeleteImage function to delete any image entry in the list. in addition to ensuring that the connections between the nodes adjacent to that one are correct.
It was much simpler to resolve these two issues after adjusting the delete.
	

Reverse:
	I simply traversed the linked list in reverse and flipped the previous and next pointers as well as the first and last pointers.


Spotlight:
	For Spotlight I made a DIP function and implemented it inside the main function of MovieLab using loops.

All the image list functions utilize pointers and making space in memory and consequently freeing that space when not needed in order to avoid memeory leaks.
	I also made 2 new functions called CreateImageentry and CreateYUVentry which essentially create an entry specifically for RGBimages and YUVImages respwctively.
	This was useful for when I had to append images into their respective lists.


Makefile:
	 I succeeded in implementing the makefile according to the targets. In order to increase efficiency i used variables so that I would not need to type
	all the command lines over and over again.
