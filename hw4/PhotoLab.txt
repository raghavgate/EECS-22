In this assignment I utilized dynamic arrays in order to conduct DIP operations on variable images. 

malloc and free are used to allocate and deallocate memory respectively when I needed to create a temporary "image" with RGB channels of their own.

GetPixel is used to obtain RGB values from the original image and setpixel is used in order to set new RGB values to the original image.

Conversely from hw3 whenever temp arrays were used, this time I had to create temporary images in memeory and used pointers and arithmetic in order to obtain the appropriate values. 

Brightness and contrast function required simple arithmetic.

Crop function required assigning and reassigning.
