The program I have written is desgined to operate 11 different digital image processing operations.

My main function calls all 11 functions as well as providing a user interactive menu. I further decided to recursively call my main function inside an else statement instead of having a while loop with a temp variable.

My first operation was black and white which required straight forward mathenmatics involving averaging the RGB intensities at every pixel in the image.

The second operation is making the negative of an image which is essentially just the inverse of all the RGB intensities at every pixel in the image obtained by adding -255 to the respective intensities.

The third operation was Color Filtering in which I used loops in order to traverse the 2d pixel array and find values in a certain range and replace them using if and else statements. More of and else statements were
	 used in order to control the upper and lower limits of the that can be targeted.

The fourth operation was edge detection which required straightforward mathematics and temp variables in order to assigne and store RGB values.

The fifth operation was shuffle in which I take the RGB values of 2 random pixel blocks and swap them. This block of code is embedded in a for loop that runs enough times to the point where every pixel block has ended up	
	in a new location than their original.

The sixth operation was hflip which uses temporary variables to store the RGB values of the right side of the image and assign them to the left side.

The seventh operation was hmirror which mirrors the left side of the image and pastes it on the right side. Again I used temporary variables in order to store the RGB intensities and assign them later.

The eigth opperation was adding borders. Unfortunately, I did not have enough time to implement this function.

The other three operations were provided by the assignment.
